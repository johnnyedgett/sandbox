This app is my first attempt at an open-source type webapp! 
Note that as of right now this is more of a sandbox for me than anything else. :)

# Usage
## Deploy the Backend
To deploy the backend, cd into the backend folder create a .env document

```ini
DB_SERVER=YOUR_MONGO_DB_SERVER
DB_DATABASE=YOUR_MONGO_DB_DATABASE
DB_PORT=YOUR_MONGO_DB_PORT
DB_USER=YOUR_MONGO_DB_USER
DB_PASS=YOUR_MONGO_DB_PASSWORD
```

Then, install the dependencies

```js
npm install
```

Finally, deploy using 

```s
gcloud app deploy
```

## Deploy the Frontend
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
